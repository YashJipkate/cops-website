Greetings,

This is the first post of COPS’ ML Summer School. The COPS’ Machine Learning Group will be posting resources and assignments every Tuesday for the next two months.

There are no major prerequisites for this course. Only basic programming skills and some high school mathematics - linear algebra (matrices), calculus and probability is required. The aim of this course is to develop your skills so that you can participate in Machine Learning competitions at the end of two months. Competitive Machine Learning is a great way for beginners to apply their machine learning skills. Also, if you wish to get into the exciting field of Data Science, your ranking on competitive Machine Learning platforms like Kaggle (kaggle.com) can very well showcase your skills.

This course will run for the next two months. We have divided the eight weeks into four parts. In the first part, you will learn Python and its Data Science libraries (NumPy, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib). Because there are a lot of topics to cover in these two weeks, we are only sharing resources on basic Python and NumPy this week.

Python and its Data Science libraries (along with R) are used predominantly in competitive Machine Learning. Python is used even in Machine Learning research, because of its simplicity and availability of a wide array of machine learning libraries in Python.

First of all, [download and install Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) - Python 3.6 version. Doing this will install Python, all the major Data Science libraries and Jupyter Notebook.

Next is the turn to run Jupyter Notebook and getting familiar with its interface. Run Jupyter Notebook by either starting the Ananconda Navigator or by typing jupyter notebook in the terminal. You can find a brief introduction on [Jupyter Notebook here](http://cs231n.github.io/ipython-tutorial/).

Now, we come to the more meatier part of this week’s material, that is to learn Python. If you have some prior programming experience, learning basics of Python won’t take long. One of the best and fastest way to learn Python is by going through the official Python tutorial (https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html). You should type in the examples given and run them in Jupyter Notebook. Reading the first nine chapters would suffice. Also, you can practice Python and get into Pythonic way of doing things by solving some problems on CodeWars (https://www.codewars.com). Be sure to read other people’s solutions after submitting yours.

Now comes the final part of this week’s task, learning NumPy. Here is an excellent tutorial for [getting started to NumPy](http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/). You can also revise Python with it. Make sure you type in and run every example in the tutorial. Only then you would get familiar with the syntax.

Best of luck going through all the resources mentioned in the post! Next week, we will be releasing the assignment and the resources for next set of topics.

If you have any query, feel free to post on ml-summer-school channel in the [COPS’ Slack workspace](https://cops-iitbhu.slack.com). Also, if you have not [joined Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cops-summer-bootcamp), join it now. It will be used primarily to post assignments and resources. This way you wouldn't miss any updates. If you wish to obtain updates from the Facebook Page itself, do not forget to turn on notifications and mark the ‘See First’ option for the page.
